[var declaration]

  1.What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. ^^^^^

    values added:  20
  
    because num1 = 10, num2 = 10, we are at add if condition, result = num1 + num2 = 10 + 10 = 20, then print result get 20.

  2.What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. 
  
    final result:  20
    
    because we already get result = 20 which is if part, and we will not run the else return which means we will not exit function. We are still in the function, and print the result which is 20
